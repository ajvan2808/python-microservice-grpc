# Online Books For You Website
âœ¨ A website implementing Python microservice with gRPC and other tools, frameworks.

To keep things manageable, only two microservices are defined:
* **Marketplace** will be a very minimal web app that displays a list of books to the user.
* **Recommendations** will be a microservice that provides a list of books in which the user may be interested.

Many technologies have been learned from this project i.e Protocol Buffer, gRPC, flask, Docker, etc.
